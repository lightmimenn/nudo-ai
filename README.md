🧠 About NudoAI

NudoAI is an AI-powered assistant focused on text generation and basic coding support.
It’s designed to assist with creative writing, documentation, and simple code-related tasks on platforms like GitHub.

✍️ Text Generation

NudoAI can:

Generate descriptive and structured texts (articles, summaries, character bios, etc.)

Write technical documentation or README files

Create dialogues, storylines, or narrative elements for games and roleplay projects

Rephrase, translate, or expand text while maintaining context and tone

💻 Coding Assistance (Light / Weak Coding)

NudoAI supports lightweight code generation — ideal for simple prototypes and automation scripts.
It can:

Write or edit small code snippets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Markdown, etc.)

Suggest syntax fixes and structural improvements

Generate starter templates for GitHub projects

Help write or format configuration files (JSON, YAML, .env, etc.)

However, NudoAI is not a full coding engine:

It may not handle complex algorithms or large-scale software systems

Code produced should be reviewed and tested manually before use in production

⚙️ Typical Use Cases

Writing documentation for GitHub repositories

Creating text content for wikis or blogs

Generating small web components or interface mockups

Drafting structured posts or roleplay materials
